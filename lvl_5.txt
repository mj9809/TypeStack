Internal weightings and threshold values for each node are determined in the initial training cycle for each neural network. The system is exposed to a series of inputs with known responses. Linear regression with backward chaining is used to iteratively determine the set of unique values required for output. Regular exposure to the training cycle results in improved accuracy and pattern matching.
In the diagram, signal strength between nodes with the strongest weightings are thicker representing a higher priority in determining the final output. The execution cycle follows the training cycle and utilises the internal values developed during the training cycle to determine the output.
Characters can be represented with ASCII or Unicode. When a developer is working with text strings, they can make use of how the text data is stored internally in its binary format to perform functions such as changing the case of letters in the string, or performing a simple encryption.
