Internal weightings and threshold values for each node are determined in the initial training cycle for each neural network. The system is exposed to a series of inputs with known responses. Linear regression with backward chaining is used to iteratively determine the set of unique values required for output. Regular exposure to the training cycle results in improved accuracy and pattern matching.
In the diagram, signal strength between nodes with the strongest weightings are thicker representing a higher priority in determining the final output. The execution cycle follows the training cycle and utilises the internal values developed during the training cycle to determine the output.
Characters can be represented with ASCII or Unicode. When a developer is working with text strings, they can make use of how the text data is stored internally in its binary format to perform functions such as changing the case of letters in the string, or performing a simple encryption.
Web development involves combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive websites. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds logic and interactivity. Backend frameworks like Flask or Node.js allow developers to manage user input, connect to databases, and serve content dynamically.
Secure software architecture is the process of designing applications that are resistant to attacks and misuse. It involves planning for authentication, data encryption, access control, and secure coding practices from the beginning of the development process. Developers must anticipate threats like SQL injection or cross-site scripting and build defences directly into the codebase.
A software engineering project combines planning, coding, testing, and evaluation into a full development cycle. It usually begins with identifying user needs and writing a problem statement, followed by prototyping and implementation. Regular testing and documentation ensure the solution meets all criteria and is maintainable in the long term.
Software automation involves creating solutions that leverage machine learning, such as using linear regression to estimate outcomes from data. Frameworks like NumPy and scikit-learn assist in building predictive models that support decision-making and automate assessments in educational contexts.
The concept of DevOps merges development and IT operations to streamline workflows. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Business Process Automation (BPA) are used to automate routine business functions. Automation enhances efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in software systems.
Secure software architecture focuses on embedding security throughout the software development lifecycle. Techniques include code review, static and dynamic application testing (SAST/DAST), and sandboxing. Security concerns like broken authentication, memory leaks, and race conditions are proactively addressed.
In web programming, technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask are used to build Progressive Web Apps (PWA). Ensuring security involves implementing HTTPS, APIs with validation, and handling exceptions effectively. Understanding SQL injection and redirect flaws is also crucial.
To maintain data privacy and regulatory compliance, developers use principles like privacy by design. This includes input validation, sanitisation, and encryption strategies. A secure system must also be resilient, handle authentication securely, and respond appropriately to threats like CSRF and XSS.
